Physical science topics are well represented and have been around longer. Solution-oriented topics, particularly in WGIII are newer and under-represented.

	\input{../tables/growth_table.tex}}

	A simple analysis of the words in the documents about climate change shows us that not only are there more articles, they discuss \textbf{new concepts}. The \textbf{topic model} below \cite{Lee1999} mobilises large patterns of words in documents to make broad conceptual developments and differences comprehensible.

	Using T-SNE \cite{vandermaaten2008}, we can project each document into a 2D space such that documents with similar 100-dimensional topic vectors are close together.
	
	\medskip
	
	 Documents similar in topic tend to be from similar disciplines, with some cross-disciplinary work around the energy system, or on soils.
	 
	 \medskip
	 
	 The majority of topics are from the natural sciences

Solutions topics have grown fast in recent assessment reports, as have topics on impacts and vulnerability. New WGII topics are better covered by IPCC reports. We can also witness the emergence of new topics such as coral bleaching.

Those WGIII topics with a higher share of social science documents are better-represented in IPCC. Either the IPCC must engage with the social science literature, or the social sciences must cover solutions-topics.
